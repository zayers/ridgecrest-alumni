    		</header>
		<p>Council Ring Hill needs to be expanded this fall to accommodate the two additional tribes for the summer of 2016. The expansion will be a major undertaking, with need for erosion control, expanded seating, excavation, and hidden retaining walls all while preserving the seemingly secluded and rustic environment generations have come to expect of Council Ring.</p>

		<p>Consider donating to the Council Ring Expansion!</p>
